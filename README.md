## *ElectricDiscoTech*
An approach to developing modern web applications

Modern web applications <small>(circa 2015)</small> treat the browser as a full runtime environment. The explosion
of opensource, freely available frameworks, the cloud, containerization, devops and tooling enable any developer
with a spark of an idea to "create", build, package and deploy functional, scalable, data driven web applications
by simply investing a little bit time and energy in learning the "right" set of stuff. The trick then is to know
how to quickly provision a useable development environment so that the focus remains on the content and not the
technology.
